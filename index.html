        <h1>GitX-dev</h1>

<p>GitX-dev is a fork (variant) of <a href="http://gitx.frim.nl/">GitX</a>, a long-defunct GUI for the <a href="http://git-scm.com/"><em>git</em></a> version-control system.  It has been maintained and enhanced with productivity and friendliness oriented changes, with effort focused on making a first-class, maintainable tool for today's active developers.</p>

<h1>Features and Status</h1>

<p>Building on the solid foundation of GitX, GitX-dev provides:</p>

<ul>
<li>History browsing of your repository</li>
<li>See a nicely formatted diff of any revision</li>
<li>Search based on author or revision subject</li>
<li>Look at the complete tree of any revision

<ul>
<li>Preview any file in the tree in a text view or with QuickLook</li>
<li>Drag and drop files out of the tree view to copy them to your system</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support for all parameters git rev-list has</li>
<li>Good performance on large (200+ MB) repositories</li>
</ul><p>GitX-dev is further specialised for software developers, and is used day-to-day in production environments.  We consider it to be feature-complete for most git workflows, with only uncommon or potentially-destructive commands requiring <code>git</code> command-line interaction.</p>

<p>As a collaboration tool for a diverse team trying to make other things; we take feedback seriously from everyone involved in software production.  We want to make good version control an invisible, second-nature step of everyone working on a product.  Re-work sucks.</p>

<h2>How is it better?</h2>

<p>GitX-dev includes a selection of improvements from around the GitX fork community.</p>

<ul>
<li>The awesome branch/remote/tag sidebar from <a href="http://gitx.laullon.com/">GitX (L)</a>
</li>
<li>Clickable commit references in blame view</li>
</ul><p>There are also a range of visible and under-the-hood changes to make GitX-dev a distinct improvement on other forks you may find.</p>

<ul>
<li>Notably better performance on large repositories</li>
<li>Reliable in-app updates thanks to <a href="http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/">Sparkle</a>
</li>
<li>Significantly reduced (<a href="rowanj/gitx#2">and shrinking</a>!) use of <code>git</code> command-line tool in favour of direct use of <a href="https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2">libgit2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/libgit2/objective-git">ObjectiveGit.framework</a>
</li>
<li>Lower, more regular memory footprint due to porting to Objective-C Automatic Reference Counting</li>
<li>Improvements to the command-line <code>gitx</code> tool</li>
</ul><h2>Does this come at a cost?</h2>

<p>Monetarily? No, GitX-dev will always be freely available.  But with a limited number of contributors, and to properly support Mac and iOS devs using the latest-and-greatest (even beta) environments; there is an obvious need to reduce the support and maintenance load.</p>

<ul>
<li>64-bit Intel only, building for other targets is left as an exercise to the would-be user</li>
<li>OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and above.  Honestly, unless somebody volunteers to maintain it, Snow Leopard is <a href="rowanj/gitx#40">likely to be dropped</a> within a few months of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion general availability; as I will no longer have the facility to build or test on it</li>
<li>Not as many graphical niceties as some forks.  Many are lacking only because of the time it would take to find and merge them; some are omitted by conscious decision to keep development focused and the high signal-to-noise ratio of the interface</li>
</ul><h2>Where can I get it?</h2>

<ol>
<li>Grab the most-recent binary from the <a href="http://github.com/rowanj/gitx/downloads">GitHub project downloads page</a>.  New builds are uploaded here periodically after significant stability or feature improvements.</li>
<li>Click the "Check for updates..." item in the GitX menu.  New builds are available through in-app update as part of a Continuous Integration scheme that deploys each time a commit is pushed, so there's bleeding-edge code here.</li>
</ol><p>GitX (R) uses the <a href="http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/">Sparkle</a> framework for in-app updates; so once you have version 0.11 or later, you can check for or update to new builds from the GitX menu at any time, or opt-in for automatic updates.</p>

<h1>Development</h1>

<p>Developing for GitX (R) has a few requirements above and beyond those
for mainline GitX.</p>

<p>Most third-party code is referenced with Git submodules, so <a href="http://book.git-scm.com/5_submodules.html">read up</a> on those if you're not familiar.</p>

<ul>
<li>Very recent Xcode install, 4.3 release strongly recommended.</li>
<li>Most development is done on OS X Lion, Snow Leopard may or may not work</li>
<li>
<code>CMake</code> with a working command-line compiling environment for building <code>libgit2</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>node.js</code> for building <code>SyntaxHighlighter</code> (not necessary unless you're updating SyntaxHighlighter itself)</li>
</ul><h1>License</h1>

<p>GitX is licensed under the GPL version 2. For more information, see the attached COPYING file.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>GitX itself is fairly simple. Most of its power is in the 'gitx' binary, which
you should install through the menu. the 'gitx' binary supports most of git
rev-list's arguments. For example, you can run <code>gitx --all' to display all
branches in the repository, or</code>gitx -- Documentation' to only show commits
relating to the 'Documentation' subdirectory. With `gitx -Shaha', gitx will
only show commits that contain the word 'haha'. Similarly, with 'gitx
v0.2.1..', you will get a list of all commits since version 0.2.1.</p>

<h1>Helping out</h1>

<p>Any help on GitX is welcome. GitX is programmed in Objective-C, but even if
you are not a programmer you can do useful things. A short selection:</p>

<ul>
<li>Give feedback</li>
<li>File <a href="https://github.com/rowanj/gitx/issues?labels=Bug">bug reports</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rowanj/gitx/issues?labels=Feature">feature requests</a>.</li>
